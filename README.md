 ( progression of index page.)
I started to make the navigation bar using list elements class then linked them using href element. this took me around 1 hour and got no errors. next was the css page where edited the navigation items to change the font, colour, position and hover items. ive added in colour and different effects to make the navigation bar fixed when scrolling and to stand out. the css was the hardest part and has taken around 2-3 hours and is still ongoing.
