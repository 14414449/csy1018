 ( progression of index page.)
I started to make the navigation bar using list elements class then linked them using href element. this took me around 1 hour and got no errors. next was the css page where edited the navigation items to change the font, colour, position and hover items. i've added in colour and different effects to make the navigation bar fixed when scrolling and to stand out. the css was the hardest part and has taken around 2-3 hours and is still ongoing.

(progression of contact )

I started the contact page by researching a static form and looking at how I was going to create a simple form where the user can input their name and details into a form with a submit button on my website. I started by created the different text areas on the html doc by creating a class then using labels taking roughly about 2-3 hours. CSS was to mainly add in a black border around the form and to set up the layout on the page using padding and different layout elements
