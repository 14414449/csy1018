      <p> My name is Joshua Challand and I have had an intrest in computing ever since I was able to use one! I'm 22 and currently enjoying life being a student mainly because of the student discounts, big summer holiday and of course the university work!  <br /> <br />I am currently studing computing at the University of Northampton and I am in my first year. during this year I have managed to gain first hand experience in e-commerce, programming using distinct languages, computer architecture and database skills and so far have enjoyed every minute of it. <br /> </p>
      <p><br /> Some Hobbies include football, where I play around 3 times a week and have done since I was 6. I find this as the best way to relax in my spare time. </p>
